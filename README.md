# Skynet

Skynet is a command-line program that can generate stories based on a template written in a scripting language called Sky.

While the program was originally created to generate a novel for National Novel Writing Month, it may also be used for other creative writing projects as well.

Though the program's source code is licensed under the MIT, the Sky files may be placed under their own individual licenses.
